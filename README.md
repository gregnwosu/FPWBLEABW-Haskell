# FPWBLEABW-Haskell
Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire - in Haskell instead of the eye numbing mathematical notation

http://eprints.eemcs.utwente.nl/7281/01/db-utwente-40501F46.pdf in Haskell using the translation guide from @ezyang http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/05/bananas-lenses-envelopes-and-barbed-wire-a-translation-guide/ an attempt to translate the papers mathematical symbols into notation that uses haskell instead

The format inside the repository will be in Org-mode with Haskell in Babel sections. From there its easy to publish to HTML or PDF

Hopefully after the translation is done I (and others) will be able to to understand the paper
