# FPWBLEABW-Haskell
Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire - in Haskell instead of the eye numbing mathematical notation

Using the translation guide from @ezyang http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/05/bananas-lenses-envelopes-and-barbed-wire-a-translation-guide/ an attempt to translate the papers mathmeatical symbols into notation that uses haskell instead

The format inside the repository will be in Org-mode with Haskell in Babel sections.

Hopefully after the translation is done I will be able to to understand the paper
